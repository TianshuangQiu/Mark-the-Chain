tonight, with hands shaking, i told you that you were a star --
and yes, i meant it (of course i did).

i saw you cry tonight --
was it for the first time? was it for the hundredth time?
(it doesn’t matter.)
i gave you a tight hug, a real one.
you were
so happy and
so sad, and
all i felt was love for you.

you asked me to make it better,
so i tried as hard as i could,
because what else would i do?
i sat with you and i made you laugh.
i don’t remember exactly what i said
(it doesn’t matter),
but i hope i made you feel okay.
i hope i did the right thing.
i hope i was good.
tell me: am i good?

we sat with our knees touching;
we sat with matching grins.
i don’t know if this was an accident,
or if it was the cosmos willing us together.
(it doesn’t matter.)
i wished you the best of luck,
and you walked away, quiet as always,
and i tried to stop my knee
from shaking.

we are sitting here together, dear friend,
two radiant balls of light in quiet darkness.
we have nothing to lose, dear friend;
we are Endless -- i’m sure of it.

for the first time in a while,
i’m sure of it.
